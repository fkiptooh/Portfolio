## Sanity
If you haven't heard of sanity before, sanity is an easy to configure and set up Content Management System. I choose sanity becase this is a relatively small project which woudn't require too much complexities to set up and configure.

To get sanity up and running visit their official site: https://www.sanity.io/ to get started and start building you content management system.
